 AMPW | SUPPORT written this for the bugs in pcc2
That's the options you have 
1. Wait for the update (but it is a 50/50 possibility that it will be fixed)
2. Delete a game and start with a new account
3. Start a game with a guest account, pass that problematic order and rewrite their old account with a progress of guest account.
You can't just delete the game. It is better to start from the beginning.

 Yui | I thought it was fixed by now
 AMPW | Old users which updated the game can get it
 AMPW | Only new users won't get it
