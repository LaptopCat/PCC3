 TheBloxian | Works normally
 TheBloxian | Why is this
 ¥£$ | One ticket is enough
 TheBloxian | Why is this
 TheBloxian | You didn't respond and skipped
 ¥£$ | When you start the game with wifi then close it and start it again without wifi it still doesn’t work?
 TheBloxian | Let me try 1 second
 TheBloxian | Nope still doesnt work

 Yui | I don't think you understand the importance of device information, and especially if other people have the same problems too. Please either just report it to <#610448258292121628> or don't create a ticket at all.
