 ABHOY | Hi
 ABHOY | How can I help you
 strki | Hello
 strki | I just downloaded the game and my loading screen is stuck on Painting PC Cases
 ABHOY | Did you try reinstall
 strki | Yes, still the same
 ABHOY | Which phone are you using
 strki | iPhone 11
 ABHOY | Is there any update in the game  ?
 strki | Checked app store, there is not
 strki | When i try to launch the game without wifi it says there is an update but there is nothing on the app store
 ABHOY | Are you using internet?
 strki | yes
 strki | tried both wifi and mobile data
 ABHOY | There is no fix and idk, so wait for the updates
 ABHOY | Did you know the version of the game ?
 strki | downloaded the game 10 mins ago so its the latest probably
 strki | 5.8.0
 Yui | <@287872434273517570> Please try clearing the cache of the game in your iPhones app-settings
 strki | I managed to fix the issue with a couple of phone restarts but while playing the game my phone gets really hot after a few minutes, is that going to be fixed soon?
 ¥£$ | …
 ¥£$ | You never used an iPhone right?
 Yui | i did
 Yui | you can clear cache in settings - storage - apps -your app - clear cache
 ¥£$ | There will be a fix for hot temperatures soon
 ¥£$ | No
 ¥£$ | There is no option to clear cache
