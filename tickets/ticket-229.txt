 fractions | my game is black screen after i updated
 fractions | on my emulator
 fractions | before the easter hotfix, i didnt even have access to th easter update
 fractions | after i got the update, i have black screen
 fractions | i tried clear data and reinstall but nothing worked
 Yui | Which emulator do you use?
<@380231712354992152>
 fractions | nox
 fractions | it worked fine for momths until the easter update
 Yui | Hmmm, nox usually works
 Yui | Have you tried reinstalling?
 fractions | reinstalling nox?
 fractions | might try that but it would be such a pain to do it just because of one game
 fractions | have like 10 games in there and none of them have issues
 Yui | No, the game
 fractions | yeah i did
 fractions | ^
 Yui | You could try installing memu
 Yui | I play on that and for me it works
 Yui | If not, try leaving the game running on blackscreen in nox for atleast 1 hour, that may fix the blackscreen since the new update introduced many bugs.
 fractions | yeah i'll try
 fractions | i do have memu and it works fine but the emulator itself is very unstable for me
 fractions | it hangs a lot and i have a gaming laptop
 fractions | nox is smooth af
 Yui | Yeah, it depends on what you prefer. Just write here if you tried an we will see...
 AMPW | I'm using memu for me is it same, just  a black screen
 fractions | oh shi
 fractions | welp then its probably an issue from the developers
 fractions | ðŸ˜­
 AMPW | I'm not sure but maybe it's because the performance issues on mobile phones
 AMPW | on another memu with older pcc the game starts but only to say that there is a update available
 AMPW | I also tested it without internet connection but it doesnt work so its probably a bad from the devs
 fractions | yep
 Yui | ,close
