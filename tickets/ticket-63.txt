 ¥£$ | When did you download the game
 ImKeith | Week ago
 ¥£$ | Its weird
 ¥£$ | I think you maybe have to reinstall and use a new account
 Yui | Sorry, i had an essay, like ¥£$ already said, just try to download it again with a new account. If you dont want to loose your progress, just wait for the big update (full release) that comes out once the war in Ukraine is over.
