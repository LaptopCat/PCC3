 SafiHit | I can't verify any order even when I press the button it doesn't work
 SafiHit | Only the decline button works . It is not only this order but it has also been the same for 6 other orders
 SafiHit | I am also not getting any new orders more than 2 hours have passed
 SafiHit | Finally when I enter the game it says that I have a download although I downloaded the game today and Google play store says that I don't have any download and the bug report button in the game doesn't work
 SafiHit | I can type about the bug but when I have to send the bug it doesn't verify
 SafiHit | Also when I entered the game it said that it detected that I had a different account on my device (I had one like 2 years ago) so I told them that I want to load my saved account but everything that was in my account is gone the only thing left is my username
 SafiHit | Please help me thanks in advance
 ¥£$ | Try to reinstall
 ¥£$ | And probably create a new account
 SafiHit | It finally worked. The reason this happened is because when I reloaded my old account I was level 1 but I had orders from when I used to play the game 2 years ago which I couldn't get unless I leveled up so I declined all the orders and restarted the game. It is working now
