 ¥£$ | Hi what is your problem
 abujad | Hello, I am an Arab streamer on Facebook and they asked me to do a live broadcast of your game, but I found a problem in the Arabic language in it, and I felt that I would be unfair in my evaluation. Please let me know if you have a solution to a problem before I remove the ads from it so that I can try it in a fair way.
 ¥£$ | I would suggest to use English language until we fix the problem
 abujad | I have no problem with the language, but my audience is of different age groups, so I care about it so that my evaluation is fair in front of everyone
 abujad | I will remove the ads but I'm afraid of other problems I can't play and it's full of ads and some of them are immoral
 ¥£$ | We are trying to fix your problem 
But I can’t say when it’s fixed
