 Minsoo | Hi
 Minsoo | I want to know how i can get through the david mission
 Minsoo | I installed the window 10, photoshop and approved it
 Minsoo | However, it seems that I can't pass the mission.
 Minsoo | I've been playing your games for a long time. I hope that I can get quick solutions
 AMPW | Hi
When did you installed the game, what game version are you using and do you installed the game through the Google play store?
 Minsoo | I installed the game about a week ago and i'm using the 0.14.0 version. I also used the google play store to download this app.
 Minsoo | Is the David mission blocked on purpose?
 ABHOY | It's a bug
 Masterwinter | No it's a bug and there's like no fix, almost no one can go pass it
