 ABHOY {INDIAN} | How can I help you
 AMPW | Hi
 christiantrejo13 | Did they fix the problem with david?
 christiantrejo13 | On pcc2
 AMPW | No
 ABHOY {INDIAN} | Help him?
 AMPW | Yes for new users
 ABHOY {INDIAN} | Ok
 AMPW | That's what support said are your options:
1. Wait for the update (but it is a 50/50 possibility that it will be fixed)
2. Delete a game and start with a new account
3. Start a game with a guest account, pass that problematic order and rewrite their old account with a progress of guest account.
You can't just delete the game. It is better to start from the beginning.
