 Styx | this quest is impossible without the card itself being unlocked, forcing us to trade for it
 Masterwinter | It can be unlocked by doing conference minigame( 2020 March 5 spring conference)
 Styx | when is that
 Styx | it seems like conferences only happen when i progress through the quests
 Masterwinter | Leveling up will unlock the next conference
 Masterwinter | But make sure you also do the story to avoid getting soft locked
 Styx | alright
 Styx | what level do i need to unlock the 2020 spring conference
 Masterwinter | 29 I think
 Styx | alright
 Masterwinter | Anything else?
