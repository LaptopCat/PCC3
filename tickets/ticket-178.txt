 Relatru89 | how can i play pc creator on an emulator?
 Yui | Which one?
 Relatru89 | pc creator
 Yui | Just download it from the play store
 Relatru89 | What emulator can I use to make it work?
 Relatru89 | I tried with bluestacks but it doesn't work
 Yui | I personally use Memu, but you can use nox too
 Yui | Bluestacks is bad, many games don't work with it.
 Relatru89 | Is it also valid with pc creator pro?
 Yui | Yes, just login with the account you bought PcCreator on
 Relatru89 | Thanks for the help
 Yui | Youre welcome
 Relatru89 | Why can't I download my cloud account?
 Yui | how do you mean?
 Relatru89 | I can't download my account from the cloud
 Yui | ?
 Yui | You mean your progress?
 Relatru89 | yes
 Yui | In PcCreator you can save your progress as a file. You can send that to your Emulator and upload it in there
 Relatru89 | I don't have the game on any device and I had the progress saved in the cloud, have I lost the progress?
 Yui | as far as i know, saving the progress in the cloud is very buggy. Maybe try installing google play games and reinstalling the game.
