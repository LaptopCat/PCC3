 MusicHub | Hello there I’m new to the game I just downloaded it. It now says that the system check failed and it says there is a new update ready but there is no new update.
 MusicHub | I press skip too but that didn’t work either
 Masterwinter | It's probably due to the game not being able to connect to the server to validate it
 MusicHub | How can I fix it?
 Masterwinter | Have you tried reinstalling the game?
 MusicHub | Yes 3 times
 Masterwinter | Than I don't think you can fix it
 Masterwinter | You will have to wait for servers to be back online
 MusicHub | When will that be?
 Masterwinter | I don't know
 Masterwinter | Maybe a week
 MusicHub | Oh ok
 Masterwinter | Anything else?
 MusicHub | Nope sorry to bother you
 Masterwinter | ,close
