 PC Creator 2 | The goal of this requirement is to make the PC get the specified FPS in the specified game, meaning you must test hardware and play the game on the PC till you find something that meets or beats the requirement. Parts that affect FPS are CPUs, RAM, and GPUs.

 PC Creator 2 | You are a nuclear reactor worker. Suddenly there is a power outage. Can you keep calm?
 ABHOY | Y
 PC Creator 2 | After a bit of wandering around you discover discover a flashlight. Do you take it?
 ABHOY | Y
 PC Creator 2 | You continue the search for the cause with the light of the flashlight. You see the control room. Do you enter it?
 ABHOY | Y
 PC Creator 2 | You see an LED that says EMERGENCY GENERATOR with a button underneath. Do you press the button?
 ABHOY | Y
 PC Creator 2 | You hear the rattling sound of the generator starting. The lights come on, but suddenly you hear an ear-shattering explosion. All the lights go out and it's dark again except for the glow of your flashlight. You can hear fire in the background. Are you heading towards the fire?
 ABHOY | Y
 PC Creator 2 | When you arrive at the fire, you see the destroyed airlock to the reactor core. Are you going in?
 ABHOY | Y
 PC Creator 2 | Once inside you see the reactor core glowing bright red. You also see that the cooling water has almost completely drained out. You notice: You are on the verge of a meltdown. Just as you're about to despair, you see an EMERGENCY STOP button behind a shatterable pane of glass. Are you running towards it?
 ABHOY | Y
 PC Creator 2 | When you have almost reached the glass, you see that between you and the button there is a chasm into the glowing hot cooling water. Do you jump over it?
 ABHOY | Y
 PC Creator 2 | You try to jump, but you stumble and fall into the chasm. You hit the reactor rods and you get queasy...
