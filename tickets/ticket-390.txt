 Yui (つ≧▽≦)つ | Hi!
How can I help you today?
 ABHOY | Hey
 Sytax | Hello,
I wanted to describe a issue I ended with on the game but the report didn't work :/
 Sytax | I'm too lazy to re-write it, so I'm just gonna drop that here
 Yui | <#610448258292121628>
 Sytax | Hello?
 Yui | Yes
 Yui | Just post it in <#610448258292121628>, that's what the channel is for
 Sytax | Last time I reported a bug there I got no response nor help
 Yui | Because the devs don't respond to the bugs but rather fix them smh
 Sytax | Lmao
 Sytax | Still waiting for it then
 Yui | Just post it in there, the development is going slowly due to the War in Ukraine
 Sytax | I can understand dev is taking some time
 Sytax | What I don't is the way you act and talk to people
 Sytax | Being a mod on a Discord server doesn't allow you treat players like that
 AMPW | The job of the mods is it to keep the server peaceful, not acting as devs
 Yui | The thing is that it really annoys me is that people don't read the channel description or the ticket creation embed. It clearly does not say that you are supposed to post bug reports here, and my behavior does still not justify your ignorance to server rules. The <#610448258292121628> channel is here for submitting bug reports on discord, and not the <#957034833278816316> channel. And even that still is ok if you weren't just saying *"Last time I reported a bug there I got no response nor help"* and just create a ticket for that even though you clearly know that this channel is not for submitting bugs.
 Sytax | Fact. My bad for using the wrong channel. 
However, *"We provide help with any problems you have with the game"*. I consider having issues with the game...
If you're annoyed, just take some rest, you can't be rude to anyone trying to help you/the devs.
 Masterwinter | They do, it's just that many players ask the same question. so many times in fact that they usually pin it in English chat
 ¥£$ | No reason to argue


The mods are using their free time to answer your questions
Even if they are rude sometimes you should be happy that there are people that are trying to help you
 Yui | The thing is, if we tell you to post it in <#610448258292121628> and not in here, even though you clearly know that you may not do it here and already did it in <#610448258292121628>, it is clearly a reason to not be super nice to people ^^
 Sytax | I guess you should read it since the beginning
 ¥£$ | Just post the picture in bug Reports and everything is Fine
 ¥£$ | I did
 Sytax | I'm a discord mod myself, I know how repetitive it can be. There are things you can think and not say
 ¥£$ | Why you want to argue now
 ¥£$ | You „broke the rules“ by mistake
 Sytax | I don't want, it's all about respect I'd say
 ¥£$ | .
 Sytax | I surely will
 ¥£$ | Ok Fine
