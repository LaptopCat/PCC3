 nerfine | Hello, my biggest apologizes for the bothering once more, but I'm unable to download PCC2, even trying with a VPN, unless I'm doing it wrong. May I get some help?
 nerfine | Device : OPPO A74
 AMPW | I would recommend to wait until the 18.8.2022 because there's the global release of Pcc2 but as far as I know work a VPN only if you create a new Google acc while you are connected to the a US server
