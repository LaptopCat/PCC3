 FURISALT | like?
 FURISALT | it says 9 so idk
 Masterwinter | yeah its android 9

 Masterwinter | and the devs will fix it when they can
 FURISALT | did
 FURISALT | just came here for a suggestion on what to do
 Masterwinter | just play pcc while charging?
 FURISALT | did it
 FURISALT | when i do that it has a higher chance restarting
 Masterwinter | does the restart happen only while playing pc creator or does it happen to other apps too?
 FURISALT | like 2 apps ive installled, both are made w unity, seems like unity games mainly do it
 Masterwinter | its maybe due to the unity
 FURISALT | huh
 Masterwinter | but make sure you watch the battery as it maybe near its end on life
 Masterwinter | as battery can last for so long before its unuseable
 FURISALT | its like a 3 year old battery so idk
 Masterwinter | depends on how many times you charge it
 FURISALT | like 3-6 times depending if i charged it last night
 FURISALT | per day btw
 Masterwinter | thats maybe a sign its on its life support
 Masterwinter | anyways anything else?

 Masterwinter | hardware problem we cant fix that
 Masterwinter | as its the phone maker that tries to reduce it

 FURISALT | nope though rq question
 FURISALT | what do you mean by life support
