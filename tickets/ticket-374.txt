 Toxium | I did that a few times already
 Toxium | I'll just have an occupied PC space?
 Yui | <@395128234649321472> this is a bug. It can only be fixed by starting from scratch via reinstalling the game and creating a new account. If you don't want to loose your progress, just wait for an update, the devs are working hard on fixing it.
 Toxium | Alright then
 Toxium | thx
