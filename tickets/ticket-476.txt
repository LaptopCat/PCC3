 sakura-chan | why does it that every time i erase my pcc data (1, not 2), the tutorial stopped showing up, making the game technically unplayable after i complete the first task by my self, as i already know how to. Keep in mind that the update that it always asks to download on startup, doesnt appear in the google play page in any way.
 sakura-chan | (unplayable because the second task doesnt appear and probably never will)
 sakura-chan | Can i please get some help...?
