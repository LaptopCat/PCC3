 Yui (つ≧▽≦)つ | Hi!
How can I help you today?
 oSpam | I updated it yesterday but online stuff doesn’t work still
 oSpam | How do it make sure it’s updated? App Store (iPhone)
 oSpam | 
 Yui | If you don't mind you could try reinstalling. The thing is that on iOS, applications take pretty long to get verified. So maybe try waiting a day or two. If it doesn't work then, just write here again. I'll leave the ticket open.
 oSpam | Okay, also on pc so i fully reset my pc the other week but the game was on steam. is there no way to get a backup?
 Yui | if it didnt automatically save in the steam cloud, no

 Masterwinter | As if you dont wait it might not save
