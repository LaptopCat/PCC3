 Yui (つ≧▽≦)つ | Hi <@841935496238202901>!
How can I help you today?
 Niviu | hello, i used to play pc creater game.. but when i installed it again, i couldn't find a place to login to my account.. i tried to play with one task.. but after the task finished, no task reappeared
 Niviu | and when I exit the game, then restart. everything is reset like I haven't done the task
 AMPW | Hi, are you on ios or android. If you are on Android and use the official version you can select the Google acc in the Google play games app
 AMPW | Or do you talk about Pcc2?
 Niviu | i use android
 Niviu | no i talk about pc creator
 AMPW | Did you tried restore your acc? (you need to be logged in with the same Google acc and you need to upload a save. Then you can download this save in the game settings)
 Niviu | I don't think I ever tried to recover my account. and I'm already logged into the same account when I play pc creator
 Niviu | and I've tried all my accounts to login to the game, and everything is still the same
 Niviu | oh yeah, if my account is reset or i forget to save it surely when i install it again there will be a tutorial for playing this game right? but this doesn't exist at all
 AMPW | Try to reinstall the game
 Niviu | stay the same sir
 Niviu | Thid is what it looks like when i exit the game and log in back
 Niviu | ok sir thanks.
