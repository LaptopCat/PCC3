 Dean | Hi
 Â¥Â£$ | What is your problem
 Dean | 
 Dean | ðŸ˜”
 Dean | I want to unlock the next room.
 Dean | <@!695229647021015040>
 Â¥Â£$ | Yeah I think you canâ€™t

Sometimes a new account helps but not every time

The best way is to try it and wait for an update
 Â¥Â£$ | But can you tell me when did you download the game
 Â¥Â£$ | And where
 Â¥Â£$ | Please be honest
 Dean | Okay
 Dean | Play Store
 Dean | Day: not remember
 Dean | 
 Dean | Just wait for an update?
