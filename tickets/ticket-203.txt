 GeraMak | Hi, there was a problem, I was brought several computers in the story to install Photoshop, but I had 1 space free for the PC, the second one disappeared, and now I can not pass this task, and start again is not hunting. What should I do? I registered via mail, but there is an old save, and the new one does not appear
 AMPW | I never heard something like that. When did you installed the game and do you installed it from the Google play store?
 GeraMak | Installed yesterday, the day before yesterday, with the Google Play Market
