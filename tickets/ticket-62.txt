 CuongAlan | Hi
 CuongAlan | In pcc1 game, is there have a way to enter code and get btc, eth and dogecoin?
 ¥£$ | No there is no way like this 


Only for things you bought
So when you bought crypto and you haven’t received them you can enter a code
 CuongAlan | And when pcc2 comes out, or will you release beta version to the world? I live in Vietnam and i want to play & send error to your team.
 CuongAlan | *replace "send" to "report"
 ¥£$ | The plan is to release the game world wide

But there are still some problems that need to be fixed

After the fix we will release it for all
 CuongAlan | Thanks for the reply
