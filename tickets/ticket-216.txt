 detective 2 | Am I talking to a bot or a person
 Yui | You are talking to both.
 detective 2 | Ok so do u know if google play games can save my game
 Yui | It is really buggy, sometimes it does, sometimes not.
 detective 2 | And why in my country I can't download the game from Google play store only from apk file
 Yui | Are you talking about PCC2? <@926921437808328736>
 detective 2 | Yea
 Yui | It is not available anywhere else than in the US. It will be released after the War in Ukraine is over
 detective 2 | Why
 Yui | Please do not download apk's since they are against the PlayStore ToS and is illegal in many countrys (software theft)
 Yui | Because the Devs live in the ukraine.
 detective 2 | But they don't want to stop the war (Russia)
 detective 2 | Ok that a realy good reason
