 MakeItGame | Why is it locked in my country?
 Â¥Â£$ | Itâ€™s only aviable in the USA
 MakeItGame | Why?.....
 Â¥Â£$ | For testing etc
 Â¥Â£$ | The Game isnt 100% finished so there is no point to release it in every country
 MakeItGame | But that is not fair for people who not live in usa
 Â¥Â£$ | You can use a USA account to download
 MakeItGame | How do i get one? ^^
 ABHOY | VPN*
 Â¥Â£$ | You just need to create a new google account with a VPN
 Â¥Â£$ | â€žJustâ€œ
 MakeItGame | But won't it ask me for a phone number when creating?
 Â¥Â£$ | Idk 


I donâ€™t think so 
Just try it
 MakeItGame | Olay
 MakeItGame | Is it maybe a possibility to download it via website who gives the apk? Or is that unsafe and unsecure?
 Â¥Â£$ | Dont use apks
 MakeItGame | Are they unsafe?
 Â¥Â£$ | Possible
 Â¥Â£$ | And against the rules too
 MakeItGame | Oh, okay, then not a good idea
 MakeItGame | The only possibility but too risky to do
 MakeItGame | Is it a possibility to ask a friend in the usa to download it officialy and then extract and send it to me?
 Â¥Â£$ | I donâ€™t think this is a good idea
 MakeItGame | Hm.. sad....
 MakeItGame | I mean.. i can trust him, i know him for 3 years already, i don't think he will send me a virus, even if he did, i will only play on a virtual machine
 Â¥Â£$ | Yes but the problem is that this could result in bugs
 AMPW | Yes, the devs wouldn't know if the bugs are because the apk or not.
 MakeItGame | Ohhh true
 MakeItGame | Hm... I could play it with the knowledge that bugs are not bc of the game and just do not report them?
 Â¥Â£$ | Why you canâ€™t create a US account
 MakeItGame | Google wants me to give a phone number
 MakeItGame | I do not have one from usa sadly
 Â¥Â£$ | As I said to use APKs can cause problems with security and bugs


Itâ€™s up to you but we wonâ€™t help to use an APK
 MakeItGame | For me its only important if its "legal" or not, if ya say that i am allowed to use it, then i can install it on my vm where it is impossible to cause damage, but if its not legaly allowed, then i will not do it
 Â¥Â£$ | I donâ€™t think itâ€™s 100% illegal but to extract files of a game and/or download a (modded) apk from the internet canâ€™t be completely legal
 MakeItGame | So if he just sends me the original apk from the playstore without modifying anything its okay? ðŸ˜…
 Â¥Â£$ | I still donâ€™t think thatâ€™s 100% legal
 MakeItGame | Uhm... Not sure if i should do then...
 MakeItGame | I mean... I really really really wanna play it
 MakeItGame | It is so sad that its geoblocked....
 Â¥Â£$ | Dont expect too much

There are many bugs in the game
 Â¥Â£$ | Itâ€™s better than a world wide release with game breaking bugs
 MakeItGame | Ye but... Maybe give the testers access to it
 MakeItGame | I mean... There is a special channel for it
 Â¥Â£$ | Testers are only for PCC1 stuff
 MakeItGame | So no testing for pcc2?
 Â¥Â£$ | There was a closed testing
 Â¥Â£$ | For like 5 people
 MakeItGame | That are very much compared to the people total on the server ðŸ˜‚
 Â¥Â£$ | Many testers are inactive anyways 

So no reason to give a version to them
 MakeItGame | Hm... Ya got a point
 MakeItGame | Found a solution
 MakeItGame | I asked my friend to get his old android and give me direct acess to it, so i can play on it
 Â¥Â£$ | Cool
 MakeItGame | Is there a specific time when the version will go global?
 Â¥Â£$ | No there isnâ€™t a specific date
 Â¥Â£$ | In theory 26.02.22 
But yeah then the war startedâ€¦
 MakeItGame | Oh... Ye...
 MakeItGame | Then we can just hope that everything will be fine with time
