 AMPW | OK.
 AMPW | I think <#610448258292121628> is better for this.
 dsawdsaww | Ok
 AMPW | What's your device?
 dsawdsaww | Android
 dsawdsaww | Like mobile
 AMPW | And do you have still performance problems?
 dsawdsaww | Yes
 dsawdsaww | I mean
 dsawdsaww | Just this problem
 dsawdsaww | I have a A90
 dsawdsaww | Pretty good
 dsawdsaww | It can run a lot of big games
 dsawdsaww | With 60 fps
 AMPW | OK.
 AMPW | Write a bug report in <#610448258292121628>. That's currently all I can tell you. I have no solution for this.
 dsawdsaww | Ok
 Yui | bad mod <:Stonksdown:712232673342390303>
 AMPW | ?
 Yui | mods should be able to help
 AMPW | That's the job of helpers.
 AMPW | And do you know a solution?
 Yui | yes
 Yui | reset the phone ü§ù
 Yui | its probably a game related problem in connection to the samsung firmware
 Yui | i had a a51 once and the game always crashed
 AMPW | Not a good solution
 AMPW | ||I had this bug on a emulator||
 dsawdsaww | I like drama, keep going
 Yui | it worked for me, and either the devs update, or you try completely reinstalling the game and whiping all game related data
 dsawdsaww | I did that
 AMPW | I just jused another emulator
 AMPW | To break the game even more
 AMPW | btw, better solution (originally made for a small not important bug in another game)
 AMPW | reset phone, destroy phone, nuke phone to ensure everything is gone, destroy earth, sun, galaxy and universe and then create everything new, even the game. this should work
