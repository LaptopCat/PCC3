 ABHOY {INDIAN} | hi
 ABHOY {INDIAN} | how can i help you
 Yui | Hi <@132749614037073920>!
How can I help you today?
 Aedrius | I have run into two bugs I believe
 Aedrius | 1. I purchased no ads and still run into them consistently while playing. 2. I have a regular quest to install windows and the witcher, eventhough the witcher is installed it doesn't fill the requirement for the quest
 Aedrius | I have already tried restarting, uninstalling and reinstalling as well with no luck
 ABHOY {INDIAN} | 1 . DM Support <@266306316136480770>
 Yui | You also have to create a new account to make it work.
 Aedrius | I created a new account prior to purchasing the no ad
 Yui | Just do that, or wait for the new update coming out once the war in Ukraine is over.
 Aedrius | Already did that
 Aedrius | Doesn't work
 ¥£$ | You already waited for the new update<:confused:720878987106320456>
 Aedrius | The new account obviously Jesus you think your cheeky eh
 Yui | <:hahaha6:740166145167982623>
