 nerfine | Hello ! My biggest apologizes for the bothering but I want to know if there's any translator ? I've noticed quite a lot of bad translation in French and it really bother me because it makes no sense.

Thank you!
 nerfine | If there isn't any, may I apply as one ?
 Yui | You can always apply in <#828617395571654697> just write why exactly you should be translator.
 nerfine | Alrighty ! Thanks for your answer I appreciate it
