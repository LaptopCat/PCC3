 Ghino Luqyano | I spent more than $30 but I didn’t get all of it I paid
 Ghino Luqyano | 
 Yui | Please don't create multiple tickets if you already have one
 Ghino Luqyano | The previous ticket I’ve lost it as I quit the server. It was because I purchased as well the pro
 Ghino Luqyano | And I still not being roled a Pro user
 Ghino Luqyano | So, this will be ticket that I could access
 Yui | Because you didn't proof the Purchase. How should we know if you have the pro version.
 Ghino Luqyano | I thought it’ll be automatic if I re-join the server
 Yui | No
 Yui | Due to exploits we disabled it
