 Springtrap YouTube | Hello, I have such a problem, advertising in the application does not work for me, although Wi-Fi is enabled
 Yui | How do you mean "advertising"?
 Yui | Like watching ads for rewards?
 Yui | If this is the case, restart your phone, and enable and Connect to a wifi before starting the app. If the problem persists, backup your data, and reinstall the game.
 Springtrap YouTube | Good for the help
