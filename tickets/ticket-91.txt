 ABHOY {INDIAN} | hi
 AMPW | hi
 FawnFlipper | Hi
 ABHOY {INDIAN} | how can i help you
 FawnFlipper | Ruby is not taking orders
 ABHOY {INDIAN} | its a bug?
 AMPW | when did you installed the game?
 FawnFlipper | I do not remember, but version 0.14.0
 AMPW | if you installed it before the 23.03 are this your options (thats what support told me):
1. Wait for the update (but it is a 50/50 possibility that it will be fixed)
2. Delete a game and start with a new account
3. Start a game with a guest account, pass that problematic order and rewrite their old account with a progress of guest account.
You can't just delete the game. It is better to start from the beginning.
 AMPW | the bugs with the "main" tasks should now only appear to "old" players (players who installed the game before the update)
 FawnFlipper | ok thank you very much
