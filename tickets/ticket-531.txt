 Yui (つ≧▽≦)つ | Hi!

 Yui | in pcc2?
 Spidey420 | Yeah on android
 Yui | Please wait for the update. The game will be fully released in 14 days.
 Spidey420 | 
 Spidey420 | Okay so how am I supposed to get around it in the meantime?
 Spidey420 | I spent quite a bit of money on this game so far
 Yui | This is a known bug, the only fix is to create a new account and start from scratch
 Yui | The devs are working hard, if you want to resume playing, you can either just buy a new room or wait for the fix.
 Spidey420 | How do I restore my purchases?  I seen soothing about taking screenshots of my receipts, can you help me with that possibly?
 Yui | How do you mean 'restore my purchases'?
