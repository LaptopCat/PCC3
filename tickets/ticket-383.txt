 TheBloxian | Why can't you sell the quatuam iteams. They are useless apart from getting elon musk's trophy
 Yui | You can make really strong computers out of them
 TheBloxian | But apart from that they are useless
 TheBloxian | They should be able to make money
 TheBloxian | Could you mine bitcoins with them?
 ¥£$ | No
 TheBloxian | Then they are useless
 ¥£$ | They arent
 ¥£$ | As yui said you can create the best possible pc with them

You can also use them for orders 

And claim the Elon musk task
 TheBloxian | U cant make money
 TheBloxian | Thats it
 ¥£$ | But they aren’t useless
 TheBloxian | Only used to get a trophy
 TheBloxian | All im saying is u should be able to make money

 ¥£$ | But tbh I don’t like your idea
 TheBloxian | Ok thanks
 TheBloxian | Why not
 TheBloxian | Costs loads to get the coins
 ¥£$ | Yes but the pets shouldn’t be a money farm
 TheBloxian | Pets?
 ¥£$ | Parts
 ¥£$ | My bad
 TheBloxian | Ok
 TheBloxian | I disagree
 TheBloxian | Becuase its quite hard to get lvl 30
 ¥£$ | Not really
 ¥£$ | 6 hours of playing and you are level 30
 TheBloxian | U sure?
 TheBloxian | When u start from lvl 0?
 ¥£$ | Yes
 TheBloxian | 6 hours of full on grinding
 ¥£$ | Just do the Right tasks
