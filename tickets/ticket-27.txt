 Yui | You can download PC Creator 2 only in the US currently. If you want to download it in Canada, you can use a VPN like GhostVPN, NordVPN and many others, to create an account located in the United States, and download it with that Account. The Devs said that once the Ukraine-War is over, they will release it globally.
